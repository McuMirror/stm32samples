These are my simple snippets for STM32F103-based chinese devboards

- 1_wire - pseudo-hardware realisation of 1-wire protocol
- canon_lens - Canon EF lens management
- client-term is terminal client used instead of "com"
- distance_meters - Distance meter based on ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 & Sharp 2Y0A02 IR sensor
- DMA_GPIO - simple 8-bit FSMC emulation with DMA
- GPIO_TIM - simple FSMC emulation by timer interrupts
- GPS - first approximation to GPS clock
- GPS+ultrasonic - GPS-based timelapse tool allows to get precision (milliseconds) time for four types of sensors 
- hid_mouse_keyboard - a very simple example of simultaneous STM32 work as compound USB-HID device: usb & mouse
- Jeep_generator - krancshaft signal emulator for Jeep
- keyboard_snippet - This snippet allows to emulate USB keyboard
- matrix_keyboard - connect simple matrix keyboard 3x3 or 4x4 to computer as regular USB keyboard
- nokia5110 - print on a nokia5110 display text sent by terminal  
- simple_cdc - simplest USB-CDC working in char-mode, press H for help (another commands are for LEDs switching and test of integer input)
- stepper_motion - move stepper motor 
- Timelapse_keyboard - USB-keyboard emulator that prints precision time of different sensors and switches (for sport competitions)
- ultrasonic - Distance meter based on ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 & Sharp 2Y0A02 IR sensor
- USBCDC_template - Template of USB-CDC
