### Distance meter based on ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 & Sharp 2Y0A02 IR sensor

The same on STM8: [livejournal](http://eddy-em.livejournal.com/66122.html) (on russian), [github](https://sourceforge.net/p/stm8samples/code/ci/default/tree/distance_meter/).

Allow not only to measure distance by ultrasonic distance-meter but also check transits
(Sharp sensor works at analog watchdog)
